# Welcome
Hello and Welcome to my Hacking Journey Docs Site!

This is where I dump everything I learn while trying to become less clueless in this field. No polished corporate content, no clickbait titles — just raw notes from someone still very much in the trenches.

### Here’s what you can expect:

- **Machine writeups** (HTB, Proving Grounds, TryHackMe, whatever I manage to pwn)  
  → Full thought process, dead ends, dumb mistakes, and the final “oh that’s how it works” moments.
- **Red team notes** — tricks, tools, and techniques that actually worked for me (and the ones that wasted three days).
- **Home lab adventures** — thrifted routers, Proxmox clusters, Active Directory playgrounds, and the occasional smoke coming from a switch.
- **Deep dives** into random topics that got me excited (Kerberos abuse, EDR evasion, cloud attacks, you name it).
- **Resources** that actually helped — blogs, tools, courses, YouTube channels, tweets.
- **Teaching moments** — every time I explain something to someone else, I’ll write it here so it sticks in my head (and maybe helps you too).

I’m nowhere near expert level — still a junior who spends half his day googling error messages. But writing things down forces me to understand them properly, and if even one person finds a writeup useful or avoids the same stupid mistake I made, then it’s worth it.

**Inshallah** this becomes a long series. The more I break, the more I’ll share.

First real writeup dropping soon!

Stick around if you want to learn together.

رَبِّ زِدْنِي عِلْمًا ۞ وَفَهْمًا وَحِكْمَةً
رَبِّ يَسِّرْ وَلَا تُعَسِّرْ ۞ وَتَمِّمْ بِالْخَيْرِ
```
