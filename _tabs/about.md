Hey there!

I’m just a guy from Tunisia who can’t stop learning new ways to break (and then fix) things.

Most days you’ll find me spinning up another VM, flashing a second-hand router I found at the market for next to nothing, or trying to survive the latest Hack The Box machine. My room slowly looks like a mix between a network lab and a recycling center, and I’m totally fine with that.

I’m obsessed with virtualization, automation, and anything that lets me script my way out of repetitive tasks. I read writeups for fun, write my own when I finally get that root shell, and spend way too much time keeping up with security news and random IT rabbit holes.

Right now I work as a junior cybersecurity engineer here in Tunisia. Officially I’m supposed to master the Microsoft security stack — Entra ID, Defender, Sentinel, etc. — and help companies protect their Active Directory and cloud environments. In reality, most of my time is spent experimenting, building internal labs, and learning on the job. Couldn’t ask for a better playground.

Whenever I get the chance, I love sharing what little I’ve figured out — mentoring students, doing small workshops, or just helping someone understand why their exploit didn’t work. Seeing that “ohhh now I get it” moment is the best feeling.

I’m still very much a beginner with a long way to go, but Inshallah one day I’ll deserve to be called an expert. Until then, I’ll keep learning, breaking, documenting, and teaching.

If you’re into CTFs, labs, open-source tools, or just want to geek out about security, feel free to reach out. Always down to connect, swap ideas, or contribute to anything that pushes the community forward — locally in Tunisia or anywhere else.

Let’s learn something new today.
